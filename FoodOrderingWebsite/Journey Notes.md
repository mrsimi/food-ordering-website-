# Food Ordering website.
I think i spent about three weeks on it. I built it as a microservice architecture - at least from what i know. 
I think i wasted a lot on time on UI design. First, I did this design in AdobeXd but wasn't cool when i wanted to turn it to html and css. So i went over to copy this order design from a css template. Look cool at the begining, but when i wanted to implement it into my project it wasn't looking that cool. I writing a lot of unnecessary code; i should have just  used bootstrap 4 - i mean no shame in using it. I later went on to use bootstrap 4 stole some design and had to settle with the not-so-perfect design i arrived at. 

With the Backend. I had a bit of the problem with disapperance of search result have a person has gone to the register/login page and back. Solved it using Cache.

Also, another issue was that of getting the user info to be more than email and password. Turns out dotnet core 2.2 was a bit tricky on that part. Saw this tutorials that helped me fix things up. 

## DEDUCTIONS
UI Designs are not up to game yet. I will continue to copy and steal design until I can make one of mine own. 

This project has covered topics on ecommerce; say things like bookstore, shopping mall, anything involving displaying buy and sell. 

I am still thinking about it but what if I could see someone to help me spice up the design. It could turn out to be really cool. But until then Aurevoir!
